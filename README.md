# One Way Ticket To the Future
## No B.S. Career Transition Strategy For Getting Job-Ready in Tech

This is a blog.

It existed at the first place, when I pitched Derek Sivers for a Writer job. But at the time, I was not yet a programmer. I used Weebly to host everything. So, I had a blog. I used it to write blog posts for 6 months and showcased my writing skills with real work.

A year later, I landed my dream job, working with my hero.

Later I learned coding. I used [Ghost](https://ghost.org/subscribe/trial/) to be the skeleton and built everything I wanted. 

That was that.

After buliding [site](http://wisdomtrigger.com/) after [site](http://aerowong.com/), I firmly belived anyone from any background can make a career transition into tech.

So I changed my blog theme from Personal Development to Career Transition Strategy For Getting Job-Ready in Tech.

If you're browsing GitHub and reading my words, stop lying to yourself, you have an urge to work in the tech field.
